# Predicting-Medical-Appointment-No-Shows
This repository represents a collaborative effort undertaken as part of our Data Science course.
The project leverages a variety of Machine Learning techniques to forecast patient attendance at medical appointments, employing a supervised dataset.
A team comprising five students contributed to this project, each specializing in the implementation of distinct Machine Learning methodologies.
My specific contribution to the project involved the implementation of the K-nearest neighbor technique.
